\section{Outline of Programs}
This section of the document provides a brief outline of each of the three programs included as part of this project. This includes a discussion of the basic structure, design and operation of each application.

\subsection{Event Creation Program}
The event creation program is a command line based application written in C++. Its purpose is to create the event, courses and entrants file for each event. The design of the application allows the user to create multiple events at the same time. This includes the functionality to create different course and entrants associated with different events. Each event also expects a nodes file to be given when creating the event, allowing different events to work with different sets of allowed nodes.
